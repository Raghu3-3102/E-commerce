# State Management (React Context + TypeScript)

Cart Context: Add/remove items, update quantity, persists via localStorage

Theme Context: Dark/light mode + system preference detection

No external state libraries â†’ lightweight & fast


# Core Features

Smart Search + Filters: Debounced search, sorting (price/name/rating)

Shopping Cart: Quantity update, auto total calculation, persistent cart

Dark Mode: Auto/system detection + smooth transitions

Responsive UI: Tailwind + Grid/Flex, mobile-first

#API Using Fake Store API

GET /products

GET /products/:id

# Performance

Code splitting with React.lazy

Memoization with useMemo


# Known Issues / Trade-offs

- Fake Store API occasionally responds slowly (external API limitation).
- React Context is used for global state â€” lightweight for now, but may not scale like Redux.
